# Module 5 Challenge - Athletic Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
1. Imported 2 csv files: athletic sales 2020 and 2021

## How I did my work
1. Follow the instructions on the Jupyer Notebook starter file
2. Use lesson 5_1, 5_2, and 5_3 for the command lines
3. Have minimal help from Claude AI. Since I have a SQL background these are much easier than previous modules
4. Debug and test multiple times

## Output Examples
