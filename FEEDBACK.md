Hi Ingrid,



Your submission meets all the requirements and demonstrates an excellent understanding of data analysis with pandas. 



In the first section, you successfully combined the two DataFrames into a single dataset using pd.concat, ensuring the index was reset. You also correctly converted the "invoice_date" column to a datetime data type, which is a critical step for time-based analysis. This was implemented effectively, even accounting for potential errors during conversion. Both tasks were completed perfectly, earning you the full 15/15 points.



For determining which region sold the most products, you utilized both the groupby function and a pivot_table to calculate totals by region, state, and city. The aggregated column was renamed appropriately to "Total_Products_Sold," and the results were sorted correctly to show the top five regions. This section was completed with precision, earning 15/15 points.



In analyzing which region had the most sales, you followed a similar process using groupby and pivot_table to calculate total sales for each region, state, and city. You renamed the column to "Total Sales" and sorted the results to display the top five entries in descending order. The implementation was accurate and aligned with the requirements, resulting in another perfect score of 15/15 points.



When determining which retailer had the most sales, you used both approaches to group the data by retailer, region, state, and city, accurately calculating total sales for each group. The aggregated column was renamed, and the results were sorted in descending order to display the top five retailers. This was done flawlessly, and you earned 15/15 points.



For identifying the retailer that sold the most women's athletic footwear, you began by creating a filtered DataFrame containing only the relevant product category. Using this filtered data, you calculated the total number of units sold for each retailer, region, state, and city. The aggregated column was renamed to "Womens_Footwear_Units_Sold," and the results were sorted to display the top five entries. This section demonstrated your ability to isolate and analyze subsets of data effectively, earning 20/20 points.



In determining the day with the most women's athletic footwear sales, you created a pivot table with "invoice_date" as the index and "total_sales" as the values. You resampled the data into daily bins to calculate total sales for each day and sorted the results to display the highest-selling days. The column renaming and sorting were done correctly, and this section earned 15/15 points.



Finally, for determining the week with the most women's athletic footwear sales, you resampled the pivot table into weekly bins and sorted the results by total sales. This was executed accurately, earning you 5/5 points.



The code was logically structured, and your use of pandas functions such as groupby, pivot_table, and resample was highly effective. To further enhance the analysis, consider adding visualizations such as bar charts or line graphs to provide a clearer representation of the results. Additionally, while your comments were helpful, adding brief markdown summaries of your findings in each section would make the notebook more readable and professional. Keep up the excellent work!
